"""
Regression tests for #458 — `initialize_git_in_container` .gitignore handling.

The bug: the old code ran `cat > .gitignore <<EOF ...` which clobbered any
workspace-supplied `.gitignore` (so `/trinity:onboard`'s ignore rules were
lost) and listed only shell/cache entries (so `.env` and `.mcp.json`, which
`inject_credentials` writes, were never ignored and got committed on the
initial sync). The fix replaces that truncate-and-write with an
append-if-missing merge that preserves existing rules and adds the three
patterns the reporter named.

These tests exercise the actual bash script returned by
`_build_gitignore_merge_command` against a temp directory, which is honest:
the only difference from production is the host filesystem vs. the agent
container.
