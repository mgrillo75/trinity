# Trinity Ops Agent

The Trinity Ops Agent is a Claude Code agent for operating a Trinity instance — health checks, log tailing, restarts, updates, rollbacks, diagnostics, and agent management — all from a single `.env` pointed at any server.

## When to Use

Use the ops agent instead of raw Docker commands for day-to-day Trinity operations. It codifies production runbook knowledge into repeatable skills that improve over time as new versions are published.

Use raw Docker only for one-off debugging or when the ops agent itself is unavailable.

## Getting It

### Option A: Via the trinity plugin (recommended)

If you have the abilities plugin installed, one command provisions a fresh Trinity instance and wires up the ops agent:

```bash
/trinity:deploy
```

The wizard asks where to deploy (Hetzner, GCP, AWS, DigitalOcean, or localhost), provisions the server, installs Docker and Trinity, and drops you into an ops agent already connected to your instance.

### Option B: Manual setup

Clone the repository and configure your `.env`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abilityai/trinity-ops-public
cd trinity-ops-public
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your instance's connection details
```

Then open the directory in Claude Code.

## Configuration

The ops agent connects to a Trinity instance via a `.env` file in its workspace.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SSH_HOST` | Remote only | — | Server IP or hostname. Leave empty for localhost. |
| `SSH_USER` | Remote only | `ubuntu` | SSH username |
| `SSH_KEY` | Remote only | `~/.ssh/id_rsa` | Path to private key |
| `SSH_PASSWORD` | Optional | — | Password fallback if no key |
| `SSH_PORT` | Optional | `22` | SSH port |
| `TRINITY_PATH` | Optional | `~/trinity` | Trinity install directory on the server |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Optional | — | Trinity admin password for API calls |
| `MCP_API_KEY` | Optional | — | MCP API key for agent queries |

**Local mode:** Leave `SSH_HOST` empty. All commands run directly against the local Docker daemon.

**Remote mode:** Set `SSH_HOST`. Commands are forwarded over SSH — no agent container is needed on the remote server.

## Day-to-Day Operations

### Health check

```bash
./scripts/status.sh
```

Checks all six Trinity services: backend (`8000`), frontend (`80`), MCP server (`8080`), scheduler (`8001`), Redis, and Vector (`8686`). Reports container status, HTTP endpoint responses, and the current git version.

### View and diagnose logs

```bash
# Backend
./scripts/run.sh "sudo docker logs trinity-backend --tail 100"

# Scheduler
./scripts/run.sh "sudo docker logs trinity-scheduler --tail 50"

# Specific agent
./scripts/run.sh "sudo docker logs agent-myagent --tail 50"

# Errors only
./scripts/run.sh "sudo docker logs trinity-backend 2>&1 | grep -i 'error\|exception\|traceback'"
```

### Restart services

```bash
./scripts/restart.sh
```

Restarts all platform services using `docker compose restart` — not `down/up`, which would orphan running agent containers by removing the `trinity-agent-network`.

### Update Trinity

```bash
./scripts/update.sh
```

Pulls the latest Trinity code, rebuilds platform images (`backend`, `frontend`, `mcp-server`, `scheduler`), restarts, and verifies health. Does **not** rebuild the agent base image — that image changes rarely and rebuilding it forces every agent to be re-deployed.

### Backup database

```bash
./scripts/backup.sh
```

Copies the SQLite database to `/tmp/trinity-<timestamp>.db` on the server. Run before any update or destructive change.

### Agent management

```bash
# List running agents
./scripts/run.sh "sudo docker ps -a --format '{{.Names}}' | grep agent-"

# Start / stop an agent
./scripts/run.sh "sudo docker start agent-myagent"
./scripts/run.sh "sudo docker stop agent-myagent"

# Open a shell inside an agent
./scripts/run.sh "sudo docker exec -it agent-myagent bash"
```

### SSH tunnel (remote instances)

```bash
./scripts/tunnel.sh
```

Opens SSH port-forwarding so you can access the Trinity UI (`http://localhost`) and API locally while the instance runs on a remote server.

## Rollback

If an update breaks the instance:

```bash
# Revert to the previous commit
./scripts/run.sh "cd ~/trinity && git checkout HEAD~1"

# Rebuild platform services from the reverted code
./scripts/run.sh "cd ~/trinity && docker compose build --no-cache backend frontend mcp-server"

# Restart
./scripts/restart.sh
```

## Minimum Server Requirements

| Resource | Minimum |

| CPU | 1 vCPU |
| RAM | 2 GB |
| Disk | 20 GB |
| OS | Ubuntu 22.04+ |

Supported providers: Hetzner Cloud, GCP, AWS, DigitalOcean, any Linux VM, localhost.
